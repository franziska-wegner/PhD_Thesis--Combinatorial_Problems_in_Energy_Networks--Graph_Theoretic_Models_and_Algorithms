    Instance:  & A network~\glssymbol{network}, and a
    parameter~$k\in\naturals$.\\
    % 
    Objective: & Find a set~$\glssymbol{factsbranch}\subseteq\glssymbol{edges}$
    of~\facts and a susceptance
    setting~$\glssymbol{susceptance}\in\interval_{\edge}$
    with~$\edge\in\glssymbol{factsbranch}$ such that~$k =
    \fmagnitude{\glssymbol{factsbranch}}$ is minimum among all choices
    of~$\opt_{\gls{mffp}}(\glssymbol{network})$.
