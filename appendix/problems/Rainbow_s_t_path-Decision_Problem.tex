\begin{problem}[framed]{\acrlong{strp}~$\gls{strp}(
\glssymbol{graph},c,\source,\sink)$}
    Instance: & A directed acyclic graph~$\glssymbol{graph} =
    (\glssymbol{vertices},\glssymbol{edges})$, a
    coloring~$\col\colon\glssymbol{vertices}\to\naturals$, and $\source,
    \target\in\glssymbol{vertices}$.\\
    % 
    Question: & Is there an~\source-\target-path~$\pathu$ in~\glssymbol{graph}
    such that all vertices of~$\pathu$ have different colors?
