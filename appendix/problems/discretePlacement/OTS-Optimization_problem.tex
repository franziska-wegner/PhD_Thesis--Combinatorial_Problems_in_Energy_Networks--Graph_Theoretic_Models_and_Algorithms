  % 
  Instance: & A network~\glssymbol{network}.\\%
  % 
  Objective: & Find a set~$\glssymbol{switched}\subseteq\glssymbol{edges}$ and
  an electrically feasible flow~\glssymbol{flow} in~$
  \glssymbol{network}-\glssymbol{switched}$ such that the sum of the generation
  costs~$\sum_{\vertexa\in\glssymbol{generators}}\gamma_\vertexa\left(
  \glssymbol{netflow}(\vertexa)\right)$ is minimized.%
