\begin{problem}[framed]{\mtsf~Problem with~$k$-Switches~$\gls{mtsfp}(\glssymbol{network},k)$}
    % 
    Instance: & A network~\glssymbol{network} and a parameter~$k\in\naturals$.
    \\
    % 
    Objective: & Find a set~$\glssymbol{switched}\subseteq
    \glssymbol{undirectededges}$ of switches
    with~$\fmagnitude{\glssymbol{switched}} = k$ such that~$\opt_{\gls{mpfp}}
    (\glssymbol{network}-\glssymbol{switched})$ is maximum among all choices
    of~\glssymbol{switched}.
